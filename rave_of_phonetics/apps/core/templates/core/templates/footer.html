                    <p>Use this text to IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) phonetic transcription to rule how to
                        speech a word, phrase or text. We know how hard can it be, but don't worry, there are many tools
                        that can help you out on that, for example, did you know that TO, TWO and TOO have the same
                        sound? Many people confuse the sound of TO with CHEW and here you can practice to get better!
                        If you don't know IPA, don't worry because <a href="http://bit.ly/389m6dH" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">IPA
