    transcribed including the phonetic version too. Let's say you transcribe a word that the phonetic does not exist, if 
    you click on the word you transcribed, you'll see an option to leave a suggestion to us! Thus it may be included in 
    our database. One update is related to the history table, if you transcribe a word, it goes at the beginning 
    of the list. Enjoy!`,
