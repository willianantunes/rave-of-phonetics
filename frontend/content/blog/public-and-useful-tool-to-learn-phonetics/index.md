I started a new project called Rave Of Phonetics that might help you (and me ðŸ˜…) to learn phonetics!

I started studying English a time ago and I wasn't aware I was pronouncing TO, TWO and TOO incorrectly and only got to know them by using phonetics transcription sites, before that I thought each had their own pronounciation.

There are some lack of features with these sites and just to point some:

- No history of what you researched;
- Loop speech audio to repeat the word or phrase; 
- Sharing a link to your friend through WhatsApp, WeChat, Telegram, Messenger and others.

I can implement these points and others that may come from you!

Let's build something together! Feedbacks and critics are welcome!
