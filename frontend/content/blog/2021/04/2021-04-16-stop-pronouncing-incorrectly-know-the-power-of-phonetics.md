P.O.V: you are next to introduce yourself in the new english course you enrolled in. you want to tell people that you are an engineer, that you like iced mochaccino and that you enjoy going surfing at the beach. “I work as an engineer, i love to drink iced mochaccinos, i love going to the b*tch.” Suddenly, there is a short and uncomfortable silence. The teacher promptly thanks you for your participation and moves on to the next student. However, everyone knew the slip. The dreaded confusion between the short and long I sound claimed yet another victim.



All English learners have embarrassing stories due to their incorrect pronunciation of some confusing phonemes. In English, this is common due to the phonological characteristics of the language. English is labelled as a deep, or obscure, language phonetically. This means that there is a disparity between the letters of the languages alphabet and the sounds that this letter represent in different linguistic contexts. So you can imagine how hard it is to understand its pronunciation. Sometimes you have words like ‘thought’ fonetic  and ‘though’ fonetic with a rather similar spelling but very different pronunciation...



Take the example of the comically constructed word FISH. this word is constructed based on the sounds of the language instead of the spelling. Each letter represents a theoretical version of the lettter… 



Phonetics allows you to understand the x-ray version of the letters or combinations of letters. This can be used for this… and this….



Here’s when it can help you:

When you are reading and don't know a word

When you cannot identify the sounds of a word

If you are a teacher it can help you when you teach pronunciation, make teaching resources. 

People who have problems speaking can also use it; also people who have difficulties listening. 



Phonetics is a cheat sheet for the sounds of a language. It is not the only tool you should use but it is a very helpful one. Check out those difficult sounds at our site and share this with your friends that love languages or have difficulties with pronunciation.
